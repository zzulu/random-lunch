# Random Lunch

- You have to create `arguments.py` file in the same directory as `main.py` file.
  - In `arguments.py` file, you have to define `members` and `previous_results` variables.
  - `members` variable should be a list of strings. For example:
    ```python
    members = [
        "Alice",
        "Bob",
        "Charlie",
        "David",
    ]
    ```
  - `previous_results` variable should be a list of lists of lists of strings. For example:
    ```python
    previous_groups = [
      [
          ["Alice", "Bob"],
          ["Charlie", "David"],
      ],
      # ...
    ]
    ```
