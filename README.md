# Random Lunch

- You have to create `constants.py` file in the same directory as `main.py` file.
  - In `constants.py` file, you have to define `MEMBERS` variables.
  - `MEMBERS` variable should be a list of strings. For example:
    ```python
    MEMBERS = [
        "Alice",
        "Bob",
        "Charlie",
        "David",
    ]
    ```
