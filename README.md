# Random Lunch

- You have to create `constants.py` file in the same directory as `main.py` file.
  - In `variables.py` file, you have to define `members` and `previous_groups` variables.
  - `members` variable should be a list of strings. For example:
    ```python
    members = [
        "Alice",
        "Bob",
        "Charlie",
        "David",
    ]
    ```
  - `previous_groups` variable should be a list of lists of strings. For example:
    ```python
    previous_groups = [
        ["Alice", "Bob"],
        ["Charlie", "David"],
    ]
    ```
